# Data Science Specializations - Project Notebooks

Welcome to my Data Science Specializations portfolio! Below is a collection of notebooks showcasing the work and skills I have gained through various data science courses and specializations. Each notebook is a unique project that demonstrates different aspects of data science, such as data analysis, machine learning, visualization, and more.

## Notebooks

### 1. **Australien_weather.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook involves working with Australian weather data, where I analyze and visualize the weather patterns across various regions in Australia.
   - **Techniques Used**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   - **Key Insights**: The notebook highlights seasonal trends and correlations between different weather factors like temperature, rainfall, and wind speed.

### 2. **Automobile Sales Statistics.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook involves analyzing automobile sales statistics, focusing on the distribution of sales over time, regions, and various car models.
   - **Techniques Used**: Data wrangling, visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and descriptive statistics.
   - **Key Insights**: The analysis helps identify trends in the automobile market, such as the impact of seasons or economic factors on car sales.

### 3. **DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook provides an overview of the data science ecosystem, including tools and techniques used throughout the field.
   - **Techniques Used**: Data science tools and libraries overview.
   - **Key Insights**: An introduction to popular data science tools like Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

### 4. **Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook involves extracting stock market data using APIs and performing data visualization to analyze stock trends.
   - **Techniques Used**: API usage (e.g., Yahoo Finance), data wrangling, and time series visualization.
   - **Key Insights**: The project demonstrates how to fetch live data, clean it, and visualize stock market performance over time.

### 5. **House_Sales_in_King_Count_USA.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook focuses on analyzing housing sales data in King County, USA, to predict housing prices based on various features.
   - **Techniques Used**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning (regression models).
   - **Key Insights**: Insights include identifying the most important features that influence house prices and predicting house values based on historical data.

### 6. **Classification with Python.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook is the final assignment for the ML0101EN course, where I applied various classification algorithms to predict outcomes based on a dataset.
   - **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation using classification algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
   - **Key Insights**: The notebook demonstrates how to choose appropriate models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and others. It also highlights how to generate a detailed report based on the model evaluations.

### 7. **USA Automobile Sales Statistics Dashboard.py**
   - **Overview**: A Python-based dashboard built using Dash to visualize automobile sales statistics for the USA.
   - **Techniques Used**: Dashboard development with Dash, data visualization, and interactivity.
   - **Key Insights**: The interactive dashboard allows users to filter and explore sales data across different regions and car models.
